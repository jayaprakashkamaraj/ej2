Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. It is the world's largest software maker by revenue,and one of the world's most valuable companies. </p><br /><p>Microsoft was founded by Paul Allen and Bill Gates on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows.</p><br /><p>The company's 1986 initial public offering, and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date</p><p>As of 2015, Microsoft is market dominant in both the IBM PC-compatible operating system (while it lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android) and office software suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the operating systems of Nokia's former phones and Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface, a line of tablet computers.</p></div><div><h3>MVC</h3><p> Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the representation of information from the user's interaction with it.The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between them.</div><ul><li><b>A controller </b>can send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document).It can also send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document).</li><li><b>A model</b> notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change in its state. This notification allows the views to produce updated output, and the controllers to change the available set of commands.A passive implementation of MVC omits these notifications, because the application does not require them or the software platform does not support them.</li><li><b>A view</b> requests from the model the information that it needs to generate an output representation to the user.</li></ul><div><h3>Audi Q3 Drive</h3>It is a concept vehicle with Liquid Silver body colour, 20-inch wheels, fabric folding roof, electrically-controlled hood, 4-cylinder 2.0 TDI engine rated 204 PS (150 kW; 201 hp) and 400 N·m (295.02 lbf·ft), diesel particulate filter and Bluetec emission control system, quattro permanent four-wheel drive system with Haldex clutch, Audi S tronic dual-clutch gearbox, McPherson-strut front axle and a four-link rear axle, Audi drive select system with 3 modes (dynamic, sport, efficiency),MMI control panel with touch pad and dual-view technology, sound system with the prominent extending tweeters.</div>",
